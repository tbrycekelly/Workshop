# Day 1 Information #

The goals of the first day of the workshop are to build up a base of knowledge so that everyone is comfortable with basic programming paradigms and some of the ways in which we discuss programing languages and, in particular, python (see _jargon_ below).

## Jargon ##

One of the biggest obstacles to new learners when it comes to programming is the plethora of unfamiliar words and their inability to _Google_ for answers. It is exceedingly difficult to search for help on a topic when you are unsure of even the basic keywords in reference to the issue. For example, consider the problem below:

  \>\>\> import numpi
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ImportError: No module named numpi

For the uninitiated, this output can easily overwhelm and can lead to the user being unsure of what the problem actually is. Here, they simply misspelled __numpy__ as __numpi__ when they attempted to import the module.

Below are frequently used terminology and a basic definition. Use this for reference whenever necessary.

* __list__
* __tuple__
* __atomic__
* __command line__
* __IDE__
* __compile__
* __source code__
