# About me

I am currently a PhD student at Florida State University studying Oceanography. On any given day I might be working on a hydrodynamic model, working with samples in the lab or our on a boat somewhere. I've always found the intersection between science and computing fascinating, and if the past decade is any indication, the need for computer literate scientists and science literate programmers will only increase in the coming years.

While my formal education in computer science is pretty paltry, my interest and experience is not. I am _fluent_ in R, Java and Python and _conversational_ in C, Julia, Fortran, and Matlab. Since I use these tools almost everyday, it seems pretty clear that I should share with others what so many people have already shared with me (via online message boards, stackoverflow, websites and forums).

This Workshop is one of the many educational programs and activities that I have either organized or take part in. The need for good teaching materials reaching between science and programming has largely driven my endevours thus far. My personal website [http://tkelly.org] is a result of wanting to share with other what I would like for everyone to share. I believe that open-source and open-materials are essential to forming a community.
