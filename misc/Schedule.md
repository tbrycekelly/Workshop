### Timeit ###

### Add Some Python to your Research ###

_10-15 minutes_.

In this activity we'll try to brainstorm just a few of the ways that Python can assist you in your research. The way we'll start this is by breaking up into small groups. Once in you're groups you'll discuss you're research questions and then brainstorm way in which Python might be of use to you.

1. Break into groups of 3-4 people
2. Take turns describing your research questions. Practice your _elevator pitch_.
3. Once everyone has gone, let the group brainstorm some ideas for you. Discuss what the goals are and some of the pros and cons of the ideas presented.
4. Spend a few minutes on each person, but try to be timely (valuable skill).

Hopefully this group activity will help you to think outside the box, a bit, about how Python can help your work.
