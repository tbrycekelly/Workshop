## Setting up the Environment ##

For this workshop, we have a virtual machine (VM) disk that will ensure that all participants will have a unified interface as well as a stream-lined experience.
The disk image will be available once the packages and workshop material has been finalized. (Note: it will be a large file download).

To follow this workshop without the VM image (or to partake in the workshop from home), you will need to download and install the following software packages.

1. Python
2. IPython
3. Jupyter (aka IPython) Notebook
4. git

Detailed instructions on the setup and requirements will be available below.
